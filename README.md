Classifying Vessels Operating in the South China Sea by Origin with the Automatic Identification System

This research focuses on building classification models with multinomial responses based upon seven months of 
Automatic Identification System (AIS) data gathered from the South China Sea. The models, built using 
Gradient Boosted Machines (GBM), assess the validity of utilizing AIS to confirm an operating vessel’s origin, 
by country and geographical region. Two types of models are built. The first model captures the naturally dependent 
nature of AIS signals and serves as a proof of concept for how well a global model trained over many years could perform. 
The second model attempts to reduce the dependency between AIS signals in order to characterize maritime patterns of 
behavior by country and region. With relative accuracy, both types of models are able to predict a vessel’s origin 
and provide insight into maritime patterns of behavior.
